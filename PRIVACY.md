# Privacy Policy

This browser extension ("Check IP Details") is a free, non-commercial tool developed to help users quickly access IP-related information.

✔ No user data is collected, stored, or shared.  
✔ No tracking, cookies, analytics, or personal information are used.  
✔ The extension does not require or request access to sensitive browser data.

The extension simply sends the selected IP to public third-party services (e.g. ipwho.is, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB) for lookup — all done client-side.

⚠ DISCLAIMER: This extension is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. The developer is not responsible for any damage, loss, or misuse resulting from its use. You use it at your own risk.
